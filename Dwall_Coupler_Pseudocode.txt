Load reference data from Sheet 1 (rebar specs, max length, coupler gaps, unit weights)
Load rebar layout and quantity data from Sheet 2

For each rebar section (layer):
    Retrieve:
        - Total bar length
        - Rebar diameter
        - Number of rebars in bundle

    If maximum rebar length is undefined:
        Set default maximum rebar length = 12000 mm

    Calculate number of special-length rebars:
        number_special = ceil(total_bar_length / max_rebar_length)

    Select coupler gap based on diameter:
        If diameter > 32:
            gap = coupler gap for >h32
        Else:
            gap = coupler gap for <h32

    Compute:
        - Average bar length = total_bar_length / number_special
        - End bar length = average - (gap / 2)
        - Middle bar length = average - gap

    If number_special == 2:
        Use adjusted end bar length for both ends

    Determine required special length:
        required_length = max(end bar length, middle bar length)

    Round up required_length to nearest 100 mm → purchasable_length

    Retrieve or assign unit rebar weight based on diameter

    Convert all lengths to meters

    Compute:
        - Total special bars = number_special × rebars in bundle
        - Total end bars = 2 × rebars in bundle (or 2 if only 2 bars)
        - Total middle bars = total bars - end bars

    Calculate:
        - Required weight = (end bars × unit weight × end length) +
                            (middle bars × unit weight × middle length)
        - Purchasable weight = total bars × unit weight × purchasable length
        - Number of couplers = (number_special - 1) × rebars in bundle

    Store all computed values in summary table

End for

Compute totals across all layers:
    - Total special rebars
    - Total required and purchased weights
    - Total number of couplers

Calculate waste rate:
    waste_rate = (purchasable_weight - required_weight) / purchasable_weight

Display summary table and waste rate
Save summary table to Spreadsheet file

Return total waste, weight efficiency, and coupler count
